Eczema Extraction
Welcome to Eczema Extraction! This is a Streamlit-based web application designed for the detection and analysis of Eczema features from medical images using image processing and machine learning techniques.

Features
Image Upload: Upload medical images for analysis.
Image Segmentation: The app performs segmentation on uploaded images to isolate regions relevant to Eczema analysis.
Feature Extraction: Extracts various features such as area, color, texture, and other morphological data for further study.
Classification: Uses machine learning models to classify the extracted features and provide predictions related to Eczema severity or type.
Visualization: Displays processed images and key metrics from the analysis.
Getting Started
Access the Application: Visit the app at https://eczemaextraction.streamlit.app.
Upload an Image: Use the upload button to upload a medical image for Eczema analysis.
Run Analysis: Click "Analyze" to initiate image processing, segmentation, and feature extraction.
View Results: The results, including segmented images and classification details, will be displayed on the screen.
Technologies Used
Streamlit: For creating the web interface.
OpenCV: For image processing and feature extraction.
Scikit-Learn / TensorFlow: For the machine learning model to classify features.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and calculations.
